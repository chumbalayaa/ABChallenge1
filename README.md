skrollr-boilerplate
===================

A complete boilerplate for use with skrollr.js based on the original HTML5 Boilerplate.

Includes:
-------------------
- Modernizr for Html5 support on IE < 10;
- ES5 Shim for ECMA 5 Javascript methods support on IE;
- Jquery Transit animation Library;
- Jquery 1.9.0;
- IE7/IE8/IE9.js to make IE "behave like a standards-compliant browser";
- PIE.htc extension to give IE support for rounded borders, box shadows and css gradients;

Notes: 
-------------------
It is possible to strip out any reference to skrollr.js and get a complete boilerplate to start working with modern features on all browsers (it improves the original HTML5 Boilerplate in many ways).
